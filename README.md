You should be familiar with this code, but go ahead and execute it to make sure it’s working as expected.

Let’s now make our fizzbuzz more robust and flexible.

### Task 1 
Refactor (improve) this code by implementing a method (called `fizzbuzz`) that takes in the starting and ending number so that we can programmatically change which numbers our fizzbuzz starts and ends at, instead of the usual 1 and 100. 

### Task 2 
Think about other methods that can be implemented to further refactor this code and make it more readable. Remember that readability does not necessarily mean fewer lines of code.
